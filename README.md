The goal of this internship is to build a video game and in the process experience what it's like to write code.

This read me includes useful information and links that will be useful throughout this internship.

## Terminal cheat sheet

The terminal is a text based interface used to control a computer.  It is commonly used in software development for it's power and flexibility.

> NOTE when an example has square brackets it indicates input and they are not included in the entered command.

- `cd [DirectoryPath]`    - change directory to location specified in path.  
  - e.g. `cd src` will open the `src` directory.
- `cd ..`                 - go to the parent directory of the current directory.
- `ls`                    - list contents of current directory.
- `mkdir [Directory Name]` - Make directory with the specified name.  
  - e.g. `mkdir src` will make a directory with the name `src`.
- `git clone [URL To Repo]` - Download a git repository into the current directory
- `git status`              - Status of the current git repository (must be run from within repo directory)
- `git add .`               - Add all new files to git repository
- `git commit -a -m"[commit message]"`           - Commit all uncommitted changes as a 'ChangeSet'.
- `git push`                - Push all local change sets to git repo
  - you will need github account and write access to repo
- `git pull`                - Pull all changes to repo from server into your local copy of the repo
