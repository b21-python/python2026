## Turning on the Pi

> IMPORTANT: Connect power LAST

Connection checklist

- Connect keyboard and mouse via one of 4 USB ports
- Turn monitor on
- Connect USB power via port next to HDMI
- Pi should turn on automatically, if it does not after a few seconds press the power button

## Go github.com

- This material can be found at `https://github.com/b21-python/python2026`
- Everything we will be reviewing today is in the `day1` folder.

## Open development environment

We will use Thonny for development.  It is a simple development environment designed for ease of use.

- Open the Thonny app by clicking Berry->Programming->Thonny
- Go to python101.md on github.com

## Creating a github account

GitHub is a platform to store, share and collaborate with others to write code.  Code is stored in a 'repository' that tracks changes over time.  The repositories are stored using a version control system called 'git'.

To create an account

- Go to github.com
- Click the sighup button.  You must provide a valid email address but accounts are free
- Share your account handle with me so I can add you to the github org where we will store our projects

## Turning the Pi off

> IMPORTANT: Unpluging the USB power before the Pi fully powers off can corrupt the SD card

Shutdown checklist
- Choose shutdown by clicking Berry->Logout then choosing Shutdown
- Display will go black but there will still be text at the bottom of the screen.  Wait until this goes away
- The Activity light will still be blinking.  Wait until it stops blinking
- The display will go into sleep mode
